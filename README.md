# SealDemoExample
I have simply created a Xamrin.forms project and then added the Seal Nuget packge from the nuget package manager.
As you can see Ciphertext does not throw and error,this dosent make sense to me as if the .dll is not being found then none of the functionality should be available. I have however been getting warnings that my Project architecture "MISL" is not matching the architecture of the package seal.
